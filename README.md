The International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration
([IAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration))
is a transliteration scheme that allows the lossless romanisation of Indic
scripts as employed by Sanskrit and related Indic languages. It is based on
a scheme that emerged during the nineteenth century from suggestions by Charles
Trevelyan, William Jones, Monier Monier-Williams and other scholars, and
formalised by the Transliteration Committee of the Geneva Oriental Congress,
in September 1894. IAST makes it possible for the reader to read the Indic text
unambiguously, exactly as if it were in the original Indic script. It is this
faithfulness to the original scripts that accounts for its continuing popularity
amongst scholars.
